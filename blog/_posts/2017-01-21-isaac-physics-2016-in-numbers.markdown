Isaac went from strength to strength in 2016; we had nearly 30,000 users sign up, and saw 1.6 million question parts answered by 29,000 active students! (Though 20% of our new users haven't answered any questions, yet!). More than 14,000 assignments were set by 1,100 teachers.

The new academic year starting in September led to a lot of questions being answered, though it fell off towards Christmas:

We can also look at how many of our students were active in answering questions through the year:

	<figcaption>The number of question attempts drops before December, but the number of users making those attempts doesn't. Does this show students getting better at answering our questions? Are they mastering significant figures? Or are they just getting less productive as Christmas draws near?</figcaption>

One last chart, showing lots of homework set by our teachers; hard at work even through their summer holidays:

Let's see what 2017 brings!
