Marking mathematical formulae online is a particularly hard problem. In this post I'll deal with the difficulties of entering equations - we'll save the issue of marking for another day.

There are no good ways of entering equations into computers, especially for people on mobile devices, so we had to come up with something new. Below you can play with the first beta of our equation editor. Drag and drop symbols from the palettes around the edge, and click to type numbers. If the computer has recognised your equation, it will render what it thinks you entered in the space at the bottom.
