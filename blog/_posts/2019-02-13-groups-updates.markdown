Today we've updated the way groups work on Isaac, to help you better understand which groups you are in and give you a little more control over assignments. We have added a list of all the groups you're in to your <a href="https://isaacphysics.org/account#teacherconnections" target="_blank">Teacher Connections</a> tab which now shows the names of the groups, the teachers associated with each group and allows you to temporarily leave a group.

When you leave a group, you'll no longer see new assignments nor receive notifications about assignments set to that group, although previous assignments will still show up. You'll still appear in the teacher's list of students in the group and they'll still be able to see your progress on past assignments. We really expect this feature to be useful if you've joined one of our mentoring schemes and would like a break, or if you've moved classes at school and haven't yet been removed from an old group by the teacher. It's worth noting that once you rejoin a group, you'll see all the assignments that were set whilst you were inactive.

<b>Teachers:</b>

As we've made clear on the <a href="https://isaacphysics.org/groups" target="_blank">Manage Groups</a> page since October, we're now sharing the name of a group with your students if you've updated the group in any way since October. This should help them keep track of which groups they are in and, in the longer term, easier to see who has set them homework for which class. We've made it very clear on the Manage Groups page if the group name is shared with the students.

You may see students groups listed as "inactive in group" now; as descibed above this means they won't receive new assignments set to that group.
