As of today, text entry is available to everyone on Isaac attempting symbolic questions. Whilst it's still not perfect, it's come a long way and is quite useful for both really short equations and really long ones.

You can type equations in a format loosely based on Python; we've added some help text to give some examples of what works. If you want to learn more about how it works, <a href='/equation-editor-text-entry.html' target='_blank'>this post contains quite a few examples</a>, and <a href='/equation-editor-text-entry-grammar.html' target='_blank'>this post explains more about how we turn what you type into an equation you can edit</a>.
