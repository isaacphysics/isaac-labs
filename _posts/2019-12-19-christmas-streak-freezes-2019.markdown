Just [like we did last year]({{ '/christmas-streak-freezes' | relative_url }}), we're freezing daily streaks for Christmas. 

**As a Christmas present from us, we'll freeze the streaks of everyone who has a current streak this week for the 24th-26th December inclusive**.

This will allow you to have Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day off from answering Isaac questions; a likely well-deserved rest! You'll need to answer questions as usual on the 27th to avoid losing your streak though!

Fair warning, it's currently impossible to know if your streak is frozen or not; so don't panic if you don't see any messages. And if you do lose a long streak over the Christmas break <a href="https://isaacphysics.org/contact?subject=Streak%20Freeze" target="_blank">let us know</a>. We'll see what we can do!
