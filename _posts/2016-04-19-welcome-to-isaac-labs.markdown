Welcome to <b>Isaac</b> <span class="capsule">Labs</span>, brought to you by the team behind <a href="https://isaacphysics.org">Isaac Physics</a>.

It takes a lot of work to deliver innovative new features on Isaac Physics, and that means we often can't share them with you as soon as we would like. Isaac Labs is a place for you to discover and try our latest tools before they make it to the main site.

Bear in mind that the technology we share here is beta-quality at best - some parts will be missing, there will be bugs, and you should explore at your own risk!

So, let's get started. Head over to <a href="/marking-equations.html">our first post about the difficulties of marking equations online</a>.
